Observations and findings:

This project uses matplotlib and panda to clean, analyze and visualize the drug regimen datasets of Pymaceuticals Inc, and find the best drug treatment options over time.

//Capomulin and Ramicane are clearly the best of the drug regimen options after 45 days treatment in terms of controlling or reducing tumor volume and metastatice sites.Infubinol, Ceftamin, and other treatments had no significant effect on average tumor volume.


//Our line charts and pie charts show that Capomulin and Ramicane chose more than 200 mice to be tested, a larger sample size compared with other groups. Male and female mice were chosen equally, 51% versus 49%.

//In linear regression analysis of Capomulin, the scattor plot indicates the strong positive correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume,  with a correlation value of 0.84 and r-squared value of 0.709,
